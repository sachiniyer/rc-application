** Code CracklePop
*Q: Write a program that prints out the numbers 1 to 100 (inclusive). If the number is divisible by 3, print Crackle instead of the number. If it's divisible by 5, print Pop. If it's divisible by both 3 and 5, print CracklePop. You can use any language.*

*Q: You can use something like GitHub's gist to host your code. It doesn't need to be long, but it should be something you've written yourself, and not using a framework (e.g., Rails). If you don't have anything to submit, code something small, like a game of tic-tac-toe.*

The no frameworks restriction throws me for a bit of a loop (what is a framework really?), but [[https://github.com/sachiniyer/mastodon-status][my cluster status tracker]] is a simple project that has minimal dependencies/frameworks surrounding it.

If the goal is to analyze something that does not use any packages outside of the basic language, the following two projects might be better:
- [[https://github.com/sachiniyer/batch-ansible-cli][a utility for running ansible notebooks]] (uses clap for command line parsing, and serde for serialization)
- [[https://github.com/sachiniyer/website][my website]] (almost completely pure html and css)

If none of that works I found a [[https://gist.github.com/sachiniyer/58d42efa2c48d4c8df6d9e551ecfbf18][java version of tic-tac-toe]] in my backups from 2016. I think I wrote this in 9th grade for an AP Computer Science Course. Afaik, it is backwards compatible up till Java 1.5 (when the [[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/package-summary.html][scanner module]] was introduced?).
** What is the most fascinating thing you've learned in the past month?
*Q: This doesn't have to be about programming.*

When I was in high school, I really loved mechanical engineering. This love was fostered through FIRST robotics and projects like [[https://github.com/sachiniyer/Electric-Trombone][my electronic trombone]]. I was captivated by building block concepts that are used as foundational abstractions to build more complex machines. Mechanical foundational abstractions are often more fascinating to me than software abstractions because there is a smaller abstraction stack. These concepts go straight to simple physics equations.

Some examples:
- Need to convert rotational motion into linear motion? Use a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rack_and_pinion][Rack and Pinion]].
- Want to create both longitudinal and rotational movement in your wheel base? Use a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecanum_wheel][Mecanum Wheel]].
- Struggling with machine vibration, and need to adjust for some resonant frequency? Use a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuned_mass_damper][Tuned Mass Damper]].

One of my friends, while courting an offer from [[https://apptronik.com/][apptronik]], introduced me to their novel building block of an elastic intermediary coupling two rotational components. This results in a safer and complaint rotational mechanism ([[https://sites.utexas.edu/hcrl/files/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-17-at-9.02.49-PM.png][image of the actuator]], [[https://sci-hub.ru/10.1109/tmech.2020.3036571][publication]], and [[https://sites.utexas.edu/hcrl/graduate-research/][research lab]]). I am /fascinated/ by how a seemingly simple, foundational idea can lead to such large changes in the robotics space (especially around human safety). Additionally, the idea of elastic being a force driving component is quite unintuitive to me, which makes it all the more fascinating.
** What do you want to be doing in two years?
After working in software engineering professionally for about a year, I am realizing that I want to work on a project/product that I find interesting. I hope I have made a commitment to a company and am working on that project/problem.

Interesting project/product to me is:
- Somewhat technically interesting - I need to satisfy my urge to solve puzzle-like problems
- Brings some sort of value - giving people something of value and doing general worldly good improves my self-worth
- Something I have passion for - a base emotional connection from a variety of factors (definitely the most fuzzy qualification)

Interesting project/product to me does not require (assume disjunction):
- Purely technically challenging
- Generating large monetary returns
- Attached to lots of prestige
- In a defined area of tech (e.g. machine learning)

It is hard for me to give an exact answer to what I want to be doing in 2 years (I'm hoping RC can help me figure that out). However, to be specific on what interesting project/product means to me, here are a few examples:
- Building firmware for a transformer ASIC at Etched
- Working on candle to optimize the CUDA kernel and decrease inference times at HuggingFace
- Optimizing KV Cache Compression for Workers AI at Cloudflare
- Hack on ISR to deliver content faster at Vercel
- Creating a smarter consensus system in Ray at Anyscale
- Creating smarter DDOS recognition algorithms at Internet Archive ([[https://mastodon.archive.org/@internetarchive/112513905401989149][recent incident]])
** Why do you want to attend RC? How would attending RC be different than working on your own?
*** Commitment to Unstructured Time
One of my best decisions in hindsight was to take a gap year between high school and college. It gave me unstructured time to develop a passion for technology and create some of the coolest stuff I've done to date.

A quick summary of the highlights:
- Played weekly jazz gigs at a local restaurant with my friends
- Played in 2 big bands, 2 quartets, and an orchestra
- Served with an [[https://americorps.gov/serve/americorps/americorps-vista][AmeriCorps Vista]] to teach FIRST Robotics to 3 elementary schools and 2 middle schools (and developed an educational plan to go along with it)
- Took some courses (3 community college courses, [[https://coursera.org/share/29802cca497e8680b26b241d0ef50b59][Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course]], [[https://coursera.org/share/daef661212dab251985d69e4fb71f730][AWS Certification]])
- A slew projects ([[https://github.com/sachiniyer/Hercules][singing hercules doll]], rfid implants, [[https://github.com/sachiniyer/Electric-Trombone][electronic trombone]], [[https://github.com/sachiniyer/foot-pedal][guitar foot pedal]], [[https://github.com/sachiniyer/delivery-service][grocery delivery scheduler]], [[https://web.archive.org/web/20220611100331/https://sachiniyer.com/][my original website]], websites for friends)
- Contracted for a book publisher to write them a simple [[https://github.com/sachiniyer/book-recommendation][book recommendation engine]]
- An internship at Hewlett Packard Enterprise

Since then, I have been committed to school or a company and have not had a chance to dedicate myself to pursuing projects like this. RC would give me the chance to formalize a commitment to a period of unstructured time. Without RC, I fear that I'll find myself in another structured commitment without giving myself a chance to explore some cool ideas.

My dad says "ideas are like flowers, they need room to bloom".
*** Make cool/smart friends
One of my worst decisions in hindsight was to graduate early from college. I lost a chance to interact and learn with cool/smart people in a friendly environment (especially with covid impacting my first two years). Additionally, I miss the vibrant discussions that I used to have with my friends about ideas and problems.

I see RC as a chance to recover from that loss and carve out time to build connections and learn from my peers. I would consider this goal succeeded if I maintain one connection past the RC event who I continue to learn from. Additionally, anything that I build alone will be at least marginally worse than something I build with others.
*** Recruitment Opportunities
Quoting myself from earlier, my two year goal is to "make a commitment to a company and [work] on that project/problem." I am not currently at a place where I am able to make that commitment. I hope to be in a place to make that commitment soon. I think that the recurse center could help me along that journey of finding the company and project/product that is "interesting".
** What would you like to work on at RC?
*Q: E.g., things you want to learn or understand better, projects you want to build or contribute to, etc. Consider where the edge of your abilities is, and where youâ€™d like it to be at the end of your batch.*

From my idea backlog, here are a few that I think could be a good fit:
- Framework x230: Fix my thinkpad x230 by embedding a framework motherboard inside. The complex parts would be:
  - make [[https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware][qmk]] compatible with my thinkpad x230 keyboard and touchpad
  - figure out how set up the rest of the peripherals (sleep sensor, microphone, camera...)
  - set up power distribution and battery correctly
- Hack together a wasm specific metal kernel for [[https://github.com/huggingface/candle/tree/main/candle-metal-kernels][candle]] (with [[https://tinyml.mit.edu/][tinyml]] constructs)
- Fuzz [[https://www.ray.io/][ray]] and try to submit a CVE (I've already seen some sketchy code and it seems like a good target)
- Re-implement (or implement for the first time) some seminal and novel ml papers e.g.
  - [[https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm][vllm]] in rust
  - [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16656][auxo]]
  - [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00595][monarch]]
  - [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10663][fed-ensemble]]
- Create a highly optimized generative model to produce [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpHnKaxt_OQ][zoomquilt]] style content
- If I haven't done it yet, complete most of the exercises from [[https://www.bishopbook.com/][bishop]]

I am often not able to pursue personal projects that require larger time commitments. At the end of RC, I would like to have completed one of those larger projects. Hopefully, this pushes me deal with the technical, procedural, and motivational complexities involved in completing something that takes time.
** Do you plan to attend RC in-person, remotely, or some combination of the two? How will this affect your working style?
*Q: If you'll be attending fully or partly remotely: have you worked remotely in the past? What was successful or challenging about that experience for you?*

I plan to attend in-person. I struggle to focus in remote environments, and value home and work separation.

Additionally, 397 Bridge St is 2 blocks away from where I used to live while at NYU. I would cherish the opportunity to come back.
* Background
This information will not disqualify your application. We use it to better get to know our applicants and where they currently are.
** Describe your programming background in a few sentences.
I have been programming since I was around 14 (in the aforementioned AP Computer Science Course). I pursued a bachelors degree in computer science, have done internships in various companies, and it is now my profession. For the last 3 years, I estimate my average daily heads-down coding time to be ~3hrs.
** Have you worked professionally as a programmer?
*Q: If so, please describe your experience.*

Yes, my [[https://sachiniyer.com/resume][resume]] has my full work history, but currently I work at AWS building our GenAI offering called Bedrock. Specifically, I build batch and provisioned inference (send a bunch of prompts together or reserve a dedicated endpoint to send prompts to).
** Do you have a Computer Science degree or are you seeking one?

Yes, I have a Computer Science Degree from New York University. I am not seeking to get into any programs, but have an offer for my Masters at NYU in Fall 2025 (I have not committed to attending yet).
** What other commitments (work, life, family) would you have during your batch?
*Q: RC is a full-time commitment, and we ask that you plan to participate Monday-Friday during our core hours (11 am - 5 pm ET).*

If I get into RC, I will not work during that time. I also don't have any dependents to take care of. I anticipate my other commitments being very sparse.
** How did you first hear about RC?
/Dropdown: A friend/coworker who didn't go to RC/

*Q: Where specifically (e.g., which friend, conference, etc.)?*
