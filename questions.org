** Code CracklePop
*Q: Write a program that prints out the numbers 1 to 100 (inclusive). If the number is divisible by 3, print Crackle instead of the number. If it's divisible by 5, print Pop. If it's divisible by both 3 and 5, print CracklePop. You can use any language.*

** Please link to a program you've written from scratch.
*Q: You can use something like GitHub's gist to host your code. It doesn't need to be long, but it should be something you've written yourself, and not using a framework (e.g., Rails). If you don't have anything to submit, code something small, like a game of tic-tac-toe.*

I don't fully understand what no frameworks means, but [[https://github.com/sachiniyer/mastodon-status][my cluster status tracker]] is a simple project that has minimal dependencies/frameworks surrounding it.

If the goal is to analyze something that does not use any packages outside of the basic language, the following two projects might be better:
- [[https://github.com/sachiniyer/batch-ansible-cli][a utility for running ansible notebooks]] (uses clap for command line parsing, and serde for custom object representation)
- [[https://github.com/sachiniyer/website][my website]] (almost completely pure html and css)

If none of that works I found a [[https://gist.github.com/sachiniyer/58d42efa2c48d4c8df6d9e551ecfbf18][version of tic-tac-toe]] in my backups from 2016. I think I wrote this in 9th grade for an AP Computer Science Course. Afaik, it is compatible with Java 1.5 (when the [[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/package-summary.html][scanner module]] was introduced?).

** What is the most fascinating thing you've learned in the past month?
*Q: This doesn't have to be about programming.*

When I was in high school, I really loved mechanical engineering. This love was fostered through FIRST robotics and projects like [[https://github.com/sachiniyer/Electric-Trombone][my electronic trombone]]. One of the things that fascinated me were the building block concepts that were used as foundational abstractions to build more complex machines.

Some examples:
- Need to convert rotational motion into linear motion? Use a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rack_and_pinion][rack and pinion]].
- Want to create both longitudinal and rotational movement in your wheel base? Use a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecanum_wheel][Mecanum wheel]].
- Struggling with machine vibration, and need to adjust for some resonant frequency? Use a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuned_mass_damper][Tuned Mass Damper]]

One of my friends is courting an offer from [[https://apptronik.com/][apptronik]] and introduced a new concept to me of a elastic intermediary coupling two rotational components resulting a safer, complaint rotational mechanism ([[https://sites.utexas.edu/hcrl/files/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-17-at-9.02.49-PM.png][image of the actuator]] and [[https://sites.utexas.edu/hcrl/graduate-research/][research lab]]). I am /fascinated/ by how a seemingly simple, foundational idea can lead to such large changes in the robotics space (especially around human safety).

** What do you want to be doing in two years?

** Why do you want to attend RC? How would attending RC be different than working on your own?

** What would you like to work on at RC?
*Q: E.g., things you want to learn or understand better, projects you want to build or contribute to, etc. Consider where the edge of your abilities is, and where you’d like it to be at the end of your batch.*

** Do you plan to attend RC in-person, remotely, or some combination of the two? How will this affect your working style?
*Q: If you'll be attending fully or partly remotely: have you worked remotely in the past? What was successful or challenging about that experience for you?*

I plan to attend in-person. Although I am currently based in Seattle, I struggle to work remotely, and think I would benefit from being in person. I also went to college in that same area, and would love to go back (lived next to Brooklyn Bridge Park).
* Background
This information will not disqualify your application. We use it to better get to know our applicants and where they currently are.
** Describe your programming background in a few sentences.
** Have you worked professionally as a programmer?
*Q: If so, please describe your experience.*

Yes, my [[https://sachiniyer.com/resume][resume]] has my full work history, but currently I work at AWS building our GenAI offering called Bedrock. Specifically, I build our batch inference and provisioned inference offerings.
** Do you have a Computer Science degree or are you seeking one?

Yes, I have a Computer Science Degree from New York University. I am not seeking to get into any programs, but have an offer to do my Masters at NYU in Fall 2025.
** What other commitments (work, life, family) would you have during your batch?
*Q: RC is a full-time commitment, and we ask that you plan to participate Monday-Friday during our core hours (11 am - 5 pm ET).*

If I get into RC, I do not plan to work during that time. I also don't have any dependents to take care of. I anticipate my commitments being very sparse.
** How did you first hear about RC?

*Q: Where specifically (e.g., which friend, conference, etc.)?*
