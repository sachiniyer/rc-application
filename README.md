#### Fun cracklepop (or foobar) ideas
I think most people go a PL route and chose some esolang to write it in. Ngl, it seems a little boring. I think it would be interesting to hack into some esoteric display mechanism and put the code somewhere it doesn't belong.

- use libgfxinit from coreboot to hack into the boot display - https://doc.coreboot.org/gfx/libgfxinit.html
- hack it into ebpf and run the code in kernel - https://github.com/iovisor/bcc
- hack it into the emacs modeline through a dynamically changing string - https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eintr/Mode-Line.html
